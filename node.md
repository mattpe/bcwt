# Node.js

## What is Node.js?

- "Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine."
- "Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient."
- "Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world."

## Usage

Running a JS file `my-script.js`:

```bash
node my-script.js
```

### Exercise 1

Create a folder `node` in `week1`. In the folder create file `script.js` that logs 'This is JavaScript' to console, and run it.

## npm

- npm (Node Package Manager) is the package manager for Node.js
- Has the most modules of any package manager for any language
- Comes along with Node.js when installed
- Available on command line with npm command
- [npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/) let you [search](https://docs.npmjs.com/searching-for-and-choosing-packages-to-download) for existing package
- Can update itself with

    ```bash
    npm install -g npm
    ```

## Global v.s. local packages

Global packages:

- Installed [globally](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-packages-globally) with -g switch for npm install
- Provide some command-line commands
- e.g.

    ```bash
    npm install -g angular-cli
    ng new MY_PROJECT
    ```

Local packages

- Installed [locally](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-packages-locally) to the node_modules folder under current application folder
- Available only for the current project with require
- e.g.

    ```bash
    npm install underscore
    ```

    ```javascript
    // in js file:
    const _ = require("underscore");
    ```

### Exercise 2

#### Global package

Install [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) globally (package name: nodemon) and use it to automatically reload previously created `script.js` every time you update the file. Modify the text that you log to console and save changes of `script.js` to see the automatic reload.

- Windows might give 'running scripts is disabled...' error. Fix: open Windows PowerShell as admin then run `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`

#### Local package

Install [lodash](https://lodash.com/) locally and use it to convert 'Foo Bar' to camel case. Modify `script.js` and log the result to console.

## Package.json

- JSON file to define an [npm project](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-a-package-json-file)
- Can [contain](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json):
  - Project name, description, version, license etc.
  - Dependencies
  - Required node version (engines)
  - npm scripts (covered later)
  - etc.

## Dependencies

- Multiple types of dependencies:
  - dependencies for actual run-time dependencies
  - devDependencies for development-time dependencies such as test frameworks and bundlers
  - peerDependencies for requiring certain versions of other modules to be installed when used (used for example for plugins)
  - optionalDependencies for platform-specific (Windows, OS X, etc.) packages for optimization purposes
- Dependencies can point to npm registry, Git repository, tar ball, local path
- Dependency versions can be specified as specific, greater/lower than, ranges, etc.

## Initializing new project

Run `npm init` and answer all the interactive questions to populate simple package.json (hint: first create a remote git repository (in gitlab or github or ...), clone it locally and run the `npm init` in that cloned directory).

## Installing dependencies

Install all dependencies (dependencies & devDependencies):

```bash
npm install
```

Install only dependencies:

```bash
npm install --production
```

All dependencies are stored to node_modules folder.

## Adding new dependencies

To add a new dependency for your project, you can use

```bash
npm install --save express
```

which installs the new package to `node_modules` and adds it to the `package.json`

`--save-dev` to save in `devDepencencies`

Using the dependencies: `const express = require('express');`

## Custom npm scripts

`scripts` field in `package.json` can contain custom scripts

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "karma run",
    "create-some-folder": "mkdir some && cd some && mkdir other"
  }
}
```

To run these, use:

```bash
npm run test
npm run create-some-folder
```

Certain scripts (e.g. `start` and `test`) are available without the `run`, for example:

```bash
npm start
npm run start
```

### Exercise 3

- Initialize new project (still in `node` folder)
- Install lodash as dependency
- Create a custom npm script `start` to `package.json`. The npm script should start `script.js` with `nodemon`. Run the script with `npm start`
