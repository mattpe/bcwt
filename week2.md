# Week 2
## Routing
1. Study [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)
2. During the labs we are going to make our own REST API
   * [API Documentation](apiDoc-v0.1.md) will show what kind of endpoints, responses etc. our REST API will have
   * This is the first version. Later in this couse some parts will be modified and added.
3. Setup
   * Navigate to your course folder in terminal or Git Bash
   * Create `week2` folder to your course folder: `mkdir week2`
   * Start new git repository to `week2` folder
   * Add approriate `.gitignore` (if it does not exist) to `week2` folder and commit changes to code regularly
   * [Download starter files as zip](https://github.com/patrick-ausderau/wop-starters/tree/week2-1), extract and copy all files and folders to `week2` folder
   * [Download UI files as zip](https://github.com/patrick-ausderau/wop-ui)
   * Move `wop-ui` folder to your public_html in shell.metropolia.fi or in your virtual computer. You can rename the folder if you want. This folder is needed later in the course to check access to the REST API.
   * Run `npm install` in `week2` folder
   * Run `nodemon app.js` or `node app.js` and test in browser: `localhost:3000/cat`

4. Study [Routing](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html) and [app.METHOD](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#app.METHOD)
   * Add `cat` routes to `app.js` which respond to POST, PUT and DELETE methods.
     * POST response: `With this endpoint you can add cats.`
     * PUT response: `With this endpoint you can edit cats.`
     * DELETE response: `With this endpoint you can delete cats.`
   * Test the routes with [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)

5. Study [route parameters](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html#route-parameters)
   * Use [Path variable](https://medium.com/@fullsour/when-should-you-use-path-variable-and-query-parameter-a346790e8a6d) to get a cat with a specific id from `./models/catModel.js`
     * Add new route `cat/:id` which responds to GET method
     * If the request is `cat/3`, the response should be `You reqested a cat whose id is 3`

6. Study [Router](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html#express-router) and create a route handler for `cat` path.
   * Move `cat` routes from `app.js` to `./routes/catRouter.js`
   * Test the routes with [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)
   * `./routes/catRouter.js` is a [module](https://stackify.com/node-js-module-exports/)
   * _Optional:_ Read this article about [design patterns](https://medium.com/code-to-express/tricky-design-patterns-in-javascript-part-1-ad7228d8db4d)

7. Study [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller)
   * Here is an example of MVC in express:
   ```javascript
   // Model (usually gets data from database, in this case data is hard coded)
   'use strict';
   const cats = [
     {
       id: '1',
       name: 'Frank',
       age: '6',
       weight: '5',
       owner: '1',
       filename: 'http://placekitten.com/400/300',
     },
     {
       id: '2',
       name: 'James',
       age: '4',
       weight: '11',
       owner: '2',
       filename: 'http://placekitten.com/400/302',
     },
   ];

   module.exports = {
     cats,
   };
   ```
   ```javascript
   // Controller
   'use strict';
   const catModel = require('../models/catModel');

   const cats = catModel.cats;

   const cat_list_get = (req, res) => {
     res.json(cats);
   };

   module.exports = {
     cat_list_get,
   };
   ```
   ```javascript
   // Router
   'use strict';
   const express = require('express');
   const router = express.Router();
   const catController = require('../controllers/catController');

   router.get('/', catController.cat_list_get);

   module.exports = router;
   ```
   * Modify `./controllers/catController.js` and `/` route for GET method in `./routes/catRoutes.js` by using the examples above.
   * `localhost:3000/cat` should now send a json formatted array of cats as a response. Test with Postman.

8. Study [map, reduce, filter](https://css-tricks.com/an-illustrated-and-musical-guide-to-map-reduce-and-filter-array-methods/)
   * `/:id` route for GET method in `./routes/catRoutes.js` defines which cat's data should be returned. The `id` path variable should be passed from routes to controller:
      * Add a new function `cat_get` to `./controllers/catController.js`. The function should send one cat defined with path variable as json formatted object.
      * You can use _array.filter_ or _array.reduce_ to return one cat whose id property matches to `req.params.id`.
   * `localhost:3000/cat/1` should now send a single cat as a response. Test with Postman.

9. User route
   * Use cat router and controller as an example and create new router and controller for `user` routes. The model already exists in `./models` folder
   * Add all the same features as in cat route:
      * `localhost:3000/user` lists all users
      * `localhost:3000/user/1` returns one user by id.
      * _extra:_ delete password poperty from user's data before sending.
  * Test with Postman.

10. Remeber git add/commit/...

## Middleware
1. Study [writing middleware](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/writing-middleware.html) and [using middleware](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html)

1. Earlier you moved front end files (wop-ui) to user.metropolia.fi or your virtual server. Open `wop-ui/ui1/front.html` from a/m server and check your browser's console. If the UI - in this case HTML files - originate from any other server than your express server, you'll get [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) errors in your browser's console. To fix cross-origin issue, you need te enable CORS in your Express app with [these instructions](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/cors.html).
   * Add CORS middleware and test that `wop-ui/ui1/front.html` works when you run it locally and from your server (users.metropolia.fi or virtual server)

1. Study [req.body](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#req.body) on receiving and using data sent by e.g. html form
   * Note that the earlier versions of Express required the use of body-parser middleware. [More info here](https://medium.com/@mmajdanski/express-body-parser-and-why-may-not-need-it-335803cd048c).
   * `wop-ui/ui1/front.html` contains a form that sends userdata with POST method to `http://localhost:3000/user` endpoint.
   * Add new function 'user_post' to `./controllers/userController.js`. The function should log the user data sent by the form to the console.
   * Modify `/` route for post method in `./routes/userRoute.js`. The route should execute 'user_post' function. Test with Postman and with the form in `wop-ui/ui1/front.html`

1. Files are sent in HTTP as [multipart/form-data](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST). Because Express does not handle this type by default you need to use third party middelware like [Multer](https://github.com/expressjs/multer)
   * The second form in `wop-ui/ui1/front.html` is for uploading a file
   * Add `uploads` folder to `week2` and put the folder in version control; but not its content, e.g.
     ```console
     $ mkdir uploads
     $ touch uploads/.gitkeep
     ```
     then edit `.gitignore`
     ```ignore
     # ignore content of uploads folder
     uploads/*
     # except one (empty) file to have the folder in version control
     !uploads/.gitkeep
     ```
   * Use the 'Basic usage example' in Multer's documentation as an example and add file upload functionality to `./routes/catRoutes.js`. Use `/` for POST method as route.
      * prefer relative path ('./uploads/') instead of absolute path ('/uploads/')
      * [what is the difference](https://medium.com/@colinlmcdonald/absolute-vs-relative-paths-7ffd8e31d49c)
   * Add new function 'cat_post' to `./controllers/catController.js`. The function should log the data sent by the form (req.data) and file data (req.file) to the console.
   * Modify `/` route for post method in `./routes/catRoute.js`. The route should execute the multer middleware and 'cat_post' function.
   * Check `uploads` folder after uploading to see new files.
      * Filenames are automatically hashed.
      * If you want to have more control over filenames use [Diskstorage](https://github.com/expressjs/multer#diskstorage)

1. Add all files to git, commit and push

## Database connection
1. Create new Git branch. `git checkout -b database`
2. Goal of this task is to modify the models so that the data comes from database instead of hard coded arrays.
3. Run the SQL from `tables.txt` in your database (phpMyAdmin in your virtual computer or [users.metropolia.fi/phpMyAdmin](http://users.metropolia.fi/phpMyAdmin))
4. Study [Node MySQL 2](https://github.com/sidorares/node-mysql2#readme)
    * install Node MySQL 2 as a dependency
    * also install [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#readme) as a dependency
       * `.env` (dotenv) is used to store sensitive data such as database username and password. Add `.env` to `.gitignore` so that it won't be pushed to GitHub.
       * follow the instructions of dotenv to create `.env` file
       * for virtual computer host is localhost or the ip-address
       * for metropolia's database host is mysql.metropolia.fi (if inside metropolia network or using metropolia's vpn) or localhost (if using [ssh tunnel](mysql+tunneling.md))
       * in metropolia database, name is the same as your username
       * on virtual computer, name is whatever name you give to your database
5. Add new folder `database` and add there a new file `db.js`
   * Instead of regular [connection](https://github.com/sidorares/node-mysql2#first-query) we'll use [connection pool](https://github.com/sidorares/node-mysql2#using-connection-pools):
   ```javascript
   'use strict';
   const mysql = require('mysql2');
   require('dotenv').config();

   const pool = mysql.createPool({
     host: process.env.DB_HOST,
     user: process.env.DB_USER,
     password: process.env.DB_PASS,
     database: process.env.DB_NAME,
     waitForConnections: true,
     connectionLimit: 10,
     queueLimit: 0,
   });

   module.exports = pool;
   ```
   * Example query in a model using a [promise](https://github.com/sidorares/node-mysql2#using-promise-wrapper):
   ```javascript
   // ./models/catModel.js
   'use strict';
   const pool = require('../database/db');
   const promisePool = pool.promise();

   const getAllCats = async () => {
     try {
       // TODO: do the LEFT (or INNER) JOIN to get owner's name as ownername (from wop_user table).
       const [rows] = await promisePool.query('SELECT * FROM wop_cat');
       return rows;
     } catch (e) {
       console.error('error', e.message);
     }
   };

   module.exports = {
     getAllCats,
   };
   ```
   * Use getAllCats() in controller:
   ```javascript
   // ./controllers/catController.js
   ...
   const cat_list_get = async (req, res) => {
     const cats = await catModel.getAllCats();
     res.json(cats);
   };
   ...
   ```
   * More on [async/await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function)
   * Why does the server hang if there is an error with database query? How to prevent that? [Error handling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deZP3Z33DJ4)?

6. [Prepared statements](https://github.com/sidorares/node-mysql2#using-prepared-statements)
   * Create a function getCat to `./models/catModel.js`
   * The function should make a prepared statement which executes this query: `SELECT * FROM wop_cat WHERE cat_id = X`
      * X is the path variable from route `/:id` of `./routes/catRoute.js`
   * Modify cat_get function in `./controllers/catController.js` so that it sends the path variable 'id' to getCat function of `./models/catModel.js` and then sends the data of single cat as json. Use cat_list_get function as an example.

7. Make user route to use database as well
   * Use cat model, router and controller as an example and modify user routes etc.
   * Add all the same features as in cat route:
      * localhost:3000/user lists all users
      * localhost:3000/user/1 returns one user by id.
      * _extra:_ delete password poperty from user's data before sending (= don't include it to query results).

8. Use the routes for POST method to add users and cats to database
   * Saving data to a database is mostly the same JavaScript as selecting data from a database. The difference is in the SQL query. Instead of SELECT use INSERT.
   * Adding a new user:
      * use the Add user form in `wop-ui/ui1/front.html` for testing
      * add a new function addUser to `./models/userModel.js`
         * the function should add user to the database
      * add a new function user_create_post to `./controllers/userController.js`
         * the function should receive req.body and send it to addUser function of `./models/userModel.js`
      * modify `/` route for POST method in `./routes/userRoute.js` to call user_create_post function
      * fill the Add user form in `wop-ui/ui1/front.html`, send the form and check in phpMyAdmin whether a new user has been added.
   * Adding a new cat
      * Modify the file upload form you did earlier in `wop-ui/ui1/front.html`. Add text inputs for name, age, weight and owner
      * In the server code:
         * save the file with multer to `uploads` folder (this is already done earlier)
         * _next_ save name, age, weight, owner and [filename](https://github.com/expressjs/multer#file-information) to database. Modify model, controller and route the same way as in adding a new user.
      * Testing:
         * Fill the form and send, check phpMyAdmin
         * Reload `wop-ui/ui1/front.html`

9. Better UX
   * Files in `wop-ui/ui2`  provide better UX
   * Open `front.html` in your browser and test adding cats and users (see also browser's console)

10. Use the `/` route for PUT method in `./routes/catRoute.js` to update cats in database
    * Updating data in a database is mostly the same JavaScript as saving data to a database. The difference is in the SQL query. Instead of INSERT use UPDATE.
    * Modifying a cat:
       * add a new function updateCat to `./models/catModel.js`
          * the function should modify all cat data of the selected cat (cat_id) in the database except filename
       * add a new function cat_update_put to `./controllers/catController.js`
          * the function should receive _name_, _age_, _weight_, _owner_ and _id_ in req.body and send them to updateCat function of `./models/catModel.js`
       * modify `/` route for PUT method in `./routes/catRoute.js` to call cat_update_put function
       * click on a modify-button under the cats to fill the Modify cat form in `index2.html`, send the form and check in phpMyAdmin whether the data has been modified.

11. Use the `/` route for DELETE method in `./routes/catRoute.js` to delete cats in database
    * Deleting data in a database is mostly the same JavaScript as selecting data from a database. The difference is in the SQL query. Instead of SELECT use DELETE.
    * Deleting a cat:
       * Add id parameter `/` route for DELETE method in `./routes/catRoute.js`: `/` => `/:id`
       * add a new function deleteCat to `./models/catModel.js`
          * the function should delete the selected cat's (cat_id) data from the database
       * add a new function cat_delete to `./controllers/catController.js`
          * the function should receive _id_ in req.body and send it to deleteCat function of `./models/catModel.js`
       * modify `/:id` route for DELETE method in `./routes/catRoute.js` to call cat_delete function
       * click on a delete-button under the cats to delete a cat in `index2.html`.

12. [Group the routes](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#router.route) to avoid duplicate route naming and thus typing errors.<br>E.g.
    ```javascript
    router.route('/')
      .get(catController.cat_list_get)
      .post(/* catController... */)
      .put(/* catController... */);

    router.route('/:id')
     .get(/* catController... */)
     .delete(/* catController... */);

    ```

13. Commit changes and push to GitLab or GitHub (all branches)
