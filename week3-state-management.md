# BCWT Week 3 - Maintaining state in web applications

- In any realistic interactive Web application you will come across the need of retaining information between individual pages. This is referred to as "maintaining state" or as the "persistence of data". 
   - HTTP protocol does not support this, it is a stateless protocol - every page request starts in a blank state with no knowledge of data that was available on the previous page.
- There is an easy way to transfer data provided by the user in a HTML form to another page for processing like the hidden input filed in 'Modify cat' form in `index2.html`. But what if you need to send that data further to third page (common requirement e.g. in multi-page forms on that allow users to register or sign-up to a Web service)? Certainly you do not want to ask the user re-type some data, such as his/her username.
- Server-side programming languages provide several ways to do this
  - The hidden form element can be used for simple applications
  - Cookies
  - Session variables
 
## Cookies

- A mechanism for storing data on the client computer
- The data saved in a cookie is available between separate visits to a web site
- Should not be used for permanent storage of data
  - e.g. user can access the web site from different computers, or cookies can be deleted from the browser menu. 
- Main drawback of cookies is that the user can turn them off in the client
- But cookies can be handy e.g. for storing:
   - user's preferences on the site's visual preferences, such as background color, font. 
   - session keys to provide for user identification and login to e.g. e-commerce site 
   - Note that in express you need to use a third party modules which provide [cookie](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/cookie-parser.html) and [session](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/session.html) mechanisms
   
### Cookie implementation

- Different clients implement the cookies in their specific ways, but the following are the general features that you will find in any of them:
- Cookies store variables name and value, plus additional information such as expiration time and the name of web site where the cookie came form. 
- By default web site can modify only it's own cookies 
- Cookies are sent between server and client as part of the HTTP header
   - This means that they must be sent before any HTML code.


### Cookie transactions

- A typical application of cookies consists of two transactions (four HTTP messages)
   - Client sends an HTTP request 
   - Server sends an HTTP response including the Set-Cookie header 
   - Client sends an HTTP request with the cookie in the header
   - Server sends an HTTP response

### Setting cookies

- [res.cookie](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#res.cookie)
- [cookie parser](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/cookie-parser.html)
- [example](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/expressjs/expressjs_cookies.htm)

## Session management

- Sessions provide another way to preserve data across subsequent accesses to a web site
- Using the session mechanism, a visitor accessing your web site is assigned an unique id, the so-called session id. 
- The session functions allows you to register variables to be preserved across requests
- When a visitor accesses your site, Express will check whether a specific session id has been sent with the request. If so, the prior saved environment with the registered variables is recreated.
- The session id is either stored in a cookie on the client computer, or is propagated from a call to another as part of the URL 
- Starting and resuming a session: [req.session](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/session.html#reqsession)
- [express-session](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/session.html)
- [example](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/expressjs/expressjs_sessions.htm)
  
## [Web Storage API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API)
- alternative to cookies
- useful for storing app state in client side in e.g. hybrid apps programmed with React Native or Ionic etc.
