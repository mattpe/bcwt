## Setting up the environment

1. Sign up for a free [student account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/) using your school email address & login, you should get some free credits (100 USD), [more info](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/education-hub/azure-dev-tools-teaching/program-faq)
1. Go to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/)
1. Create a resource: Virtual machine (VM), use server instance, e.g. latest Ubuntu server LTS)

    - select [VM size](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes) & disks according your needs (What is the minimum for a web server?)
    - NOTE: you have 100 USD to spend in total

1. Use SSH connection for managing your VM (`ssh username@PUBLIC_IP` in terminal/git bash or use e.g. [Putty](https://www.putty.org/))

    - Optional: use public key authenication instead of username/password: [Instructions](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-ssh-keys-on-ubuntu-22-04) 

1. Make sure you have all recent updates installed (this should be done on weekly basis)

    ```bash
    sudo apt update # checks for available updates
    sudo apt dist-upgrade # installs updates including kernel packages
    ```

## Installing & configuring web server software

### Apache web server 

1. Install

    ```sh
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt upgrade
    sudo apt install apache2
    ```
2. Check configuration files `/etc/apache2/` & start `sudo systemctl start apache2`
3. Add write permissions to your user account for the webroot folder `/var/www/html`
   1. todo: chgrp etc.
4. Copy your UI files to webroot
   1. scp or
   2. clone/pull from github
5. Test with browser

### MariaDB database server

1. Install MariaDB server:
   
   ```bash
   sudo apt install mariadb-server
   ```
1. Start and enable it:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl start mariadb
    sudo systemctl enable mariadb
    ```

2. Secure it (optional)

   In Ubuntu ([more info](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-mysql-on-ubuntu-22-04)) you don't necessary need root password at all. Just use sudo for root access: `sudo mysql -u root` 
   
   ```console
   mysql_secure_installation
   ```
   
   Note: database root user is not operating system root user! Avoid same password!

3. Connect to your database server as a root user: `sudo mysql -u root` and create a database and a user with privileges on it:

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE catdb;
   CREATE USER 'dbuser' IDENTIFIED BY 'test123';
   GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO 'dbuser'@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'test123';
   GRANT ALL ON catdb.* TO 'dbuser'@'localhost';
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   exit
   ```
   (in case you would need outside access (e.g. during project, separate database server from app server), replace `localhost` with `'%'` in the two GRANT queries).
4. Download the [cat-db-starter.sql](./cat-db-starter.sql) SQL script. Can be done directly from server using curl: `curl -O <FILE-URL>` or downloaded at first to your local computer and then uploaded with any SCP file transfer tool to the server. (e.f. with command line scp: `scp cat-db-starter.sql <YOUR-USERNAME>@<YOUR-SERVE-NAME/IP>:`) 
5. Import the tables and insert the data: `mysql -u dbuser -p catdb < cat-db-starter.sql`
6. Eventually check that data is there: `mysql -u dbuser -p catdb`

   ```sql
   SHOW TABLES;
   SELECT * FROM wop_cat;
   exit
   ```

7. (Optional) if you would like to install phpMyAdmin to administrate your databases, tables and data with a graphical user interface, check for example [instructions here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-secure-phpmyadmin-on-ubuntu-22-04)

### NodeJS application server

1. Install _node.js_ and _npm_ (read e.g. [some instructions](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-22-04)):

    ```
    curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x -o /tmp/nodesource_setup.sh
    sudo bash /tmp/nodesource_setup.sh 
    sudo apt install nodejs
    # check that the installed tools are working:
    node -v
    npm -v
    ```

1.  Configure Apache httpd server as a reverse proxy to node server:
    1.  create/edit an apache configuration file:
        ```console
        $ sudo vim /etc/httpd/conf.d/node.conf
        ```
    1.  add the following content:
        ```apacheconf
        <VirtualHost *:80>
          ProxyPreserveHost On
          ProxyPass /app/ http://127.0.0.1:3000/
          ProxyPassReverse /app/ http//:127.0.0.1:3000/
        </VirtualHost>
        ```
1.  save and restart apache server:
    ```console
    $ sudo systemctl restart httpd
    ```
1.  give permission to apache server to visit URL:
    ```console
    $ sudo setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect 1
    ```
1.  install and run your node application:
    1.  make sure you are in your home folder:
        ```console
        $ cd
        ```
    1.  clone your app (choose HTTPS (or [generate keys for SSH](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ssh/#generate-an-ssh-key-pair))):
        ```console
        $ git clone https://gitlab.metropolia.fi/<your-repo>
        ```
    1.  go to the cloned repo:
        ```console
        $ cd <your-repo>
        ```
    1.  eventually, check that you are in the right branch (checkout if not)
    1.  install dependencies:
        ```console
        $ npm i
        ```
    1.  create/edit `.env` file with your db credentials (you set in [MariaDB](#install-and-configure-mariadb-database-server), step iii):
        ```apacheconf
         DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
         DB_USER=<your-db-user>
         DB_PASS=<your-db-user_password>
         DB_NAME=<your-db-name>
        ```
    1.  run your application:
        ```console
        $ node app.js
        ```
    1.  test, open a browser and visit `http://<ip-address>/app/`
    1.  to kill the app, use `CTRL+C`, or if no more hanging in your terminal session, try `$ pkill node` or use `$ top`
    1.  to have your app running forever, including restart on crash, use e.g. [pm2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/):
        ```console
        $ sudo npm install -g pm2
        $ pm2 start app.js
        ```
    1.  if you want that the app reload on change (e.g. on next `git pull`), use the `--watch` flag.
    1.  other "pure" linux option could use [systemd](https://nodesource.com/blog/running-your-node-js-app-with-systemd-part-1/) (`systemctl`).
